## Breaking Changes

### Version 1.0.0
- Initial stable release
- No breaking changes from pre-release versions

## Migration Guide

### From Development Version
If you were using a development version:

1. Update configuration file format:
   ```bash
   cp config/settings.yaml config/settings.yaml.backup
   cp config/settings.example.yaml config/settings.yaml
   # Manually transfer your settings
   ```

2. Update command syntax:
   ```bash
   # Old (if applicable)
   python scraper.py --sub python --count 100
   
   # New
   python run.py scrape --subreddit python --posts 100
   ```

## Known Issues

### Version 1.0.0
- Large datasets (>100k posts) may require significant memory
- Some private subreddits may not be accessible
- Rate limiting may slow down very large scraping jobs

### Workarounds
- For large datasets: Use smaller batch sizes and multiple runs
- For private subreddits: Ensure proper authentication
- For rate limiting: Adjust rate_limit setting in configuration

## Performance Notes

### Benchmarks (Approximate)
- **Small scraping** (100 posts): ~30 seconds
- **Medium scraping** (1000 posts): ~5 minutes
- **Large scraping** (10000 posts): ~45 minutes

*Performance varies based on network speed, Reddit API response times, and system specifications.*

## Security Notes

### Data Privacy
- No user passwords or sensitive data are stored
- Only public Reddit data is collected
- API credentials are stored locally only

### Best Practices
- Use strong, unique Reddit API credentials
- Don't share configuration files with credentials
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
